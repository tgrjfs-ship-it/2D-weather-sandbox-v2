# 3d-weather-sandbox
this is a very complex project that simulates volumetric clouds with precipitation. i made a new version of protomanly's weather. this might cpu, gpu and ram heavy because the complex 3d scenes requires strong hardware to render.

Minimum requirements for this simulation:
CPU: Mediatek dimensity 7200 or Snapdragon 885
GPU: Mali G615 or Adreno 660
RAM: 12GB or above

if your device hardware doesn't meet the requirements, this causes huge lag and crashes
